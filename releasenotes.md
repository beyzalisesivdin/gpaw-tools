# Release notes

### Development version

* With time, `gpawsolve.py` uses many variables in it and in input files. However, it do not have a proper naming convention for these variables. Also some of the variable names are misleading the user. From this version, `gpawsolve.py` will use Snake_case variables. Variables that are affected: *mode -> Mode, fmaxval -> Max_F_tolerance, whichstrain -> Relax_cell, cut_off_energy -> Cut_off_energy, kpts_density -> Ground_kpts_dens, kpts_x -> Ground_kpts_x, kpts_y -> Ground_kpts_y,
kpts_z -> Ground_kpts_y, gpts_density -> Ground_gpts_dens, gpts_x -> Ground_gpts_x, gpts_y -> Ground_gpts_y, gpts_z -> Ground_gpts_z, Hubbard -> Setup_params, band_path -> Band_path, band_npoints -> Band_npoints, gridref -> Refine_grid energy_max -> Energy_max.*
* `find3Dmin.py` A script which draws 3D contour plot of E vs. latticeparams and show the minimum datapoint using the optimize_latticeparam.py's output, is added.

### Version 22.7.0

* `optimize_latticeparam.py` now can work for both lattice params a and c. Also draws 3D fig of Energy dependent latt_a - latt_c.
*  `quickoptimize.py` works like `gpawsolve.py` now. Its name is now `asapsolve.py`. 
* New default optimizer is QuasiNewton (BFGSLineSearch).
* New keyword `Optimizer`. Users can now choose QuasiNewton, GPMin, LFBGS or FIRE minimizer for geometry optimization. 
* `gg.py` includes all new keywords.
* Grid point density or manual grid points for axis (LCAO only).
* Include new keywords for LBFGS geometry optimization `Damping`, `Alpha` and `Max_step`.
* `Geo_optim` keyword for better optimization usage with filters (whichstrain).
* Examples are simplified. Most of the unnecessary keywords are removed.
* Proper logging for LCAO ground state calculations
* Fix LCAO spinpol calculation (Thanks to Toma Susi).
* Include new keyword `Mixer_type`.
* Fix help description text width problem.
* Execution timing data of all calculations are saved to `FILENAME-6-Result-Log-Timings.txt` file.
* Instead of direct execution, all tasks are added to task-spooler queue in `do_all_examples.sh`script.

### Version 22.5.0

* Successful HSE03, HSE06 calculations for ground state, DOS and band structure.
* New example for HSE06 calculations: `Si-with-HSE`.
* Colorize errors, warnings and information output with ANSI codes.
* Proper error handling for restart mode "file not found" error. 
* New keyword `Fix_symmetry` added to `gpawsolve.py`, `gg.py` for preserving the spacegroup symmetry during optimisation.
* Small changes in the `gg.py`
* No need to import ASE object inside optimization scripts. Optimizations are working with CIF files only.
* `gpawsolve.py` now prints previous and final spacegroup information and usable special points information for band structure calculations.
* `-v` argument now shows version information of gpaw-tools, and used GPAW, and ASE. It gives more choice for possible tarball and zipball packages. Also, it does not give an error in case of no internet connection available.
* 3 new keywords `Ground_convergence`, `Band_convergence` and `Occupation` are added to `gpawsolve.py`, `gg.py` and examples.
* Fix `do_all_examples.sh` Bash script.
* Optimization scripts do not need ASE object insertation. They can run with using CIF file as an argument.
* RawPDOS, which gives PDOS over orbitals, is added.
* For band calculations, result file in JSON format is added. This file can be opened with `ase band-structure` command.

### Version 22.4.0

* New optimization script `optimize_kptsdensity.py` for k-point density optimization instead of k-point number optimization.
* `optimize_cutoff.py`, `optimize_kpoints.py` and `optimize_latticeparam.py` have `xc_used` in parameters list.
* Naming of some of the output files are fixed. 
* Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) solution is added to optical calculations.
* 7 new keywords are added for BSE calculations. `opttype`, `optshift`, `optBSEvb`, `optbsecb`, `optBSEminEn`, `optBSEmaxEn`, `optbsenumdata`
* `Si-2atoms-optical` example is now running for both RPA and BSE. Previously, its calculation has 2 steps , now 3 steps.
* CONTRIBUTING and CODE_OF_CONDUCT information is added.
* Fix: Show atom numbers starting from 1 not 0.

### Version 22.3.0

* New calculation: with `Elastic_calc=True`, Equation of State and elastic tensor values will be calculated.
* `Elastic_calc` is added to `gg.py`.
* A new example about elastic calculations is added.
* Many comments added to `gg.py` for better understanding the code.
* `DOS_npoints` and `DOS_width` variables are added for number of points and smearing value, respectively.
* Saving PNG versions of band structure and DOS even in -d argument is not used.
* `shrinkgpw.py`command for extracting wavefunctions from huge gpw files and save with a different name.
* New benchmarks were added.

### Version 21.12.0

* EXX mode is renamed as PW-EXX.
* Default values of variables are changed.
* Previous -i (input) argument is changed as -g (geometry). It is more logical, because it is used for geometry.
* Previous -c (config) argument is changed as -i (input). It is more general, convenient and understandable.
* `gg.py` can now work with just enough number of variables. Previously, it must see all variables.
* `kpts_density` is added.
* Units used in cube file are changed for Bader analysis.
* There is no general config file anymore.
* Small bugfixes.

### Version 21.11.0

* PDOS calculations.
* PW mode can use GLLB-SC xc now.
* `optimize_cutoff.py` and `optimize_kpoints.py` can use CIF, XYZ, etc... files as input file. No need to include the ASE object inside these scripts anymore.
* The nbands parameter is changed in PW mode.
* In GW calculations, calculation could not be done because of interpolation in drawing the figure when the data did not have a minimum of 3 points. Now there is a variable to use interpolation or not.
* In GW calculations, `gpawsolve.py` can write quasiparticle energies to a file separately.
* DFT+U calculation ability is added for PW and LCAO modes.
* `gg.py` is better now. It is compatible with new arguments and removed variables. It can run in any directory and handling of `GWkpoints` and `GWtruncation` variables are correct now.
* A new argument '-d' is added. This argument makes script draw the DOS and band calculation results. In the past, it was a varible in the config file.
* `WantedCIFexport` variable is removed. 
* A new argument '-r' is added. This argument makes script pass the ground state calculations and continue with the next calculation.

### Version 21.10.1

* An important bug made it impossible to work with existing examples with `gg.py`. It is now resolved.

### Version 21.10.0

* 5 different examples are added to show simply different usage cases.
* Initializing magnetic moment problem is solved.
* Version argument is added.
* GW parameters are also added to `gg.py`
* Add some optical parameters to config files and `gg.py`.
* Major change: `gpawsolve.py` and `gg.py` are now working as commands. Config files can be used as general input files, you can put ASE Atom object plus every parameter that `gpawsolve.py` accepts. If you want, you can provide a CIF file instead of using an atom object. You can run `gpawsolve.py` and `gg.py` from any folder.
* Optical: Refractive index, extinction index, absorption, and reflectivity calculations.
* `gg.py` is now opening ase gui when the user clicks the structure image.
* New argument parsing scheme for better future usages.
* Very basic PW-EXX mode with HSE06 and PBE06. (Only some ground-state calculations.)
* Adding GW0 and G0W0-GW0 selector.
* Adding GW approximation to `gpawsolve.py` (only bands).
* Many other small corrections.

### Version 21.9.0

* Corrected `quickoptimize.py` behaviour.
* Many code quality and folder structure improvements.
* Comment additions to code.
* Better README.md.
* `gg.py` which is a GUI for gpaw-tools is added to project. It can do all `gpawsolve.py`'s features in a graphical way!
* `gpawsolve.py` can be run solely as a command now (This is needed for a GUI project).
* All three scripts`PW-Electronic.py`, `LCAO-Electronic.py` and `PW-Optical-SingleCoreOnly.py` scripts becomes a single for-all-case script: `gpawsolve.py`.
* `PW-Electronic-changename.py` script becomes `PW-Electronic.py`.
