# Ubuntu Linux installation

After [installing Ubuntu on your PC](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview), you just need to update and upgrade, before continuing:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    
## Installation of ASE and GPAW

After preparing your Linux system, you must have `ase` and `gpaw` codes on your computer. You can find more information about installation of [ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/install.html) and [GPAW](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw/install.html) from their related sites.

You need Tk library for GUI, unzip for file unzipping and for further package installations, we need PIP installer

    sudo apt install python3-tk python3-pip unzip python-is-python3

Install ASE and other math, parallel, dev libraries

    pip3 install --upgrade --user ase
    
At this point, PIP can give some warnings as:

    WARNING: The scripts f2py, f2py3 and f2py3.8 are installed in '/home/YOURUSERNAME/.local/bin' which is not on PATH.
    Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location.
    WARNING: The scripts ase, ase-build, ase-db, ase-gui, ase-info and ase-run are installed in '/home/YOURUSERNAME/.local/bin' 
    which is not on PATH.
    Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location.

Add the following line at the end of your ``~/.bashrc`` file.

    export PATH=/home/YOURUSERNAME/.local/bin:$PATH
    

After editing ~/.bashrc file quit the current shell session and start a new one (or you can use `source ~/.bashrc` command). Then continue,

    sudo apt install python3-dev libopenblas-dev libxc-dev libscalapack-mpi-dev libfftw3-dev

Create a `siteconfig.py` file:

```
$ mkdir -p ~/.gpaw
$ cat > ~/.gpaw/siteconfig.py
fftw = True
scalapack = True
libraries = ['xc', 'blas', 'fftw3', 'scalapack-openmpi']
^D
```

NOTE: If the user wants to use exchange correlations listed in [libxc library](https://www.tddft.org/programs/libxc/), 'xc' must be listed in the libraries line as shown above.
{: .text-red-200 }


Then install gpaw

    pip3 install --upgrade --user gpaw

Use `gpaw info` to see information about installation. However, PAW-datasets are not installed yet. To install it, firstly create a directory under `~/.gpaw` then install PAW datasets

    mkdir ~/.gpaw/gpaw-setups
    gpaw install-data ~/.gpaw/gpaw-setups/

## Installation of ASAP and KIM for Quick Optimization

For quick optimization, we need simple interatomic modelling. For this, we need ASAP3 for ASE, then we must install KIM with OpenKIM models and kimpy libraries.

    pip install --upgrade --user ase asap3
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:openkim/latest
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install libkim-api-dev openkim-models libkim-api2 pkg-config
    pip3 install kimpy

Then you can continue on [installation of gpaw-tools](installationofgpawtools.md)
